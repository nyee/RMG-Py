<P>
This directory contains the brute force symmetry determination program and
the associated test set. The program source code (in "C") is in <TT>symmetry.c</TT>.
As far as I know, it should be essentially platform-independent (you may have
to tinker with <TT>#include</TT>'s a little bit to get it to compile on your
system). It is known to work Ok on MS DOS, SGI Irix, and Compaq Tru64. This is 
the only file you need to get a working program. 

<P>
<TT>symmdos.zip</TT> contains a 32-bit extended MS-DOS executable file, which was 
kindly provided by Mike Peleah. This executable does not necessarily correspond 
to the source code; as of the time of the last update of this page, it was created 
from the v. 1.15 of the source code.

<P>
<TT>symmetry.zip</TT> contains the latest source code, together with the test
cases. 

<P>
You are free to use this code as long as you acknowledge me, retain the 
copyright message in the body, and do not try to sell it. I hope you'll
enjoy it.

<P>
<blink>Important!</blink> Thanks to Dr. Thomas Sommerfeld from the University of
Heidelberg, who provided a very nice test case, a <b>severe bug</b> in
recognition of odd-order improper axes has been found (and fixed) in 
<tt>symmetry</tt>. This bug was contained in all versions prior to 
v. 1.15 of January 25, 2000.
